### Issue while fetching values from Room Database

I encountered an issue while fetching values from the Room Database. The specific error message received was:

error: Not sure how to handle query method's return type (java.lang.Object). DELETE query methods must either return void or int (the number of deleted rows).
    public abstract java.lang.Object deleteAllProducts(@org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull
                                     ^
